# Exploratory data analysis project
This project was carried out following completion of the Google Data Analytics Professional course on coursera. The analysis was done in Python since I already had prior basic knowledge, understanding and passion for Python and it's statistical/visualization libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Further visualization and analysis (geospatial) was done using Tableau and can be found on {}.
